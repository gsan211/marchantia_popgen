# Scripts to recreate LD analyses

## plink.sh 
Script to first randomly sample 5k SNPs from vcf then feed into plink to calculate LD (r2) among all sites to explore LD decay patterns

## plot_ld.R
Script to visualize LD decay from file generated by plink

## plot_pi_ld.R
Script to compare diversity vs. LD decay in M. polymorpha genome
